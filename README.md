# Automated-Patch-Management-System

1. Automated Patch Management System
Project Overview:
This project involves building a system to automatically check for, download, and apply patches to a group of servers. The system ensures that servers are updated with the latest security patches and can handle rollback mechanisms in case of failures.

Features:

Scans for available updates for servers
Downloads and applies patches automatically
Monitors patch success or failure
Automatically rolls back in case of failure
Generates reports on patch status and system health
Technologies:

Java (Spring Boot)
REST APIs
JDBC for database interaction
JSON for data communication
MySQL for patch information storage
Multithreading for parallel patch deployment

Report Outline:

Introduction: Discuss the importance of patch management for security and stability.
Objectives: Automate the patching process and provide robust rollback mechanisms.
System Architecture: Explain the components like Patch Repository, Patch Service, and Database.
Implementation: Describe the Java code used, threading for parallel deployment, and database setup for patch tracking.
Testing: Discuss testing scenarios for both successful and failed patch applications.
Conclusion: Summarize the benefits of automation in patch management.
2. Containerized Application Deployment System using Java and Docker
Project Overview:
This project involves creating a containerized deployment system for Java applications using Docker. The system can take a Java application, containerize it, and deploy it in a Docker environment. It includes features like continuous integration and monitoring.

Features:

Automated containerization of Java applications
Deployment of containers to Docker
Basic health monitoring of deployed containers
Rollback in case of failed deployments
Technologies:

Java (Maven, Spring Boot)
Docker CLI integration
Jenkins for CI/CD
REST API for interacting with Docker
Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
